Save the role to make it available for assignment."

They eliminate the compromise of using generic roles."

            "answer": "No, each user can only have one role per workspace in Blue. However, custom roles can combine permissions from multiple standard roles, giving you the flexibility to create hybrid roles that meet complex permission requirements."
