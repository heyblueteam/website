                    "question": "What is a Kanban board?",
                    "answer": "A Kanban board is a visual project management tool that helps teams visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency. It uses cards and columns to represent tasks and their stages in a workflow, allowing teams to see the status of work at a glance."
                },
                {
                    "question": "How do Kanban boards improve process management?",
                    "answer": "Kanban boards improve process management by providing visual clarity of work status, reducing bottlenecks through WIP limits, enabling easy prioritization, facilitating team collaboration, and highlighting process inefficiencies. This visual approach helps teams deliver work more predictably and efficiently."
                },
                {
                    "question": "Can I customize the columns on a Kanban board?",
                    "answer": "Yes! Blue's Kanban boards are fully customizable. You can add, remove, rename, and reorder columns to match your exact workflow. Create columns for any stage like 'Backlog', 'In Progress', 'Review', 'Testing', or any custom stages your team needs."
                },
                {
                    "question": "How do I use Kanban boards for different projects?",
                    "answer": "Each project in Blue can have its own Kanban board with custom columns and workflows. You can create templates for common project types, copy board structures between projects, or start fresh with a unique setup for each project's specific needs."
                },
                {
                    "question": "Why is it called 'Kanban' and what is its history?",
                    "answer": "Kanban is a Japanese word meaning 'visual board' or 'sign'. It was developed by Toyota in the 1940s as part of their lean manufacturing system to improve efficiency. The method was later adapted for knowledge work and software development, becoming a popular agile project management approach."

                    "question": "How do I move cards between columns?",
                    "answer": "Simply drag and drop cards between columns. You can also use keyboard shortcuts, bulk actions to move multiple cards at once, or set up automations to move cards based on triggers like status changes or due dates."
                },
                {
                    "question": "Can I filter and search within Kanban boards?",
                    "answer": "Yes! Use powerful filters to show only relevant cards based on assignee, labels, due dates, custom fields, or any criteria. Save filter combinations as custom views and quickly search for specific cards using our instant search feature."

                    "answer": "Yes, cards can be assigned to multiple team members for collaborative tasks. You can also use custom fields to track different roles like 'Reviewer', 'Approver', or 'Contributor' for more complex workflows."
                },
                {

                },
                {
                    "question": "How do sub-tasks work in Kanban boards?",
                    "answer": "Create sub-tasks within cards to break down complex work. Sub-tasks can have their own assignees, due dates, and checklists. Track sub-task completion on the parent card and optionally display them as separate cards on the board."

                {
                    "question": "What are Kanban best practices?",
                    "answer": "Start with a simple board and evolve it, limit work in progress to improve flow, make policies explicit (definition of done), manage flow rather than managing people, and regularly review and improve your process based on metrics and team feedback."
                },
                {
                    "question": "How many columns should my Kanban board have?",
                    "answer": "Start with 3-5 columns representing your basic workflow (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done). Add columns only when they represent a genuine handoff or waiting state. Too many columns can create complexity without adding value."
                },

                    "question": "Should I use Kanban or other views in Blue?",
                    "answer": "Kanban boards are ideal for workflow visualization and continuous delivery. Use them alongside List view for detailed task management, Calendar view for deadline management, and Database view for data analysis. Switch between views anytime without losing information."
