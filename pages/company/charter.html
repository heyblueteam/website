            <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-8">
                Since our founding in 2018, Blue has served over 17,000 organizations across 120+
                countries. This Charter codifies the principles that have guided our journey and will
                continue to shape our responsibility to the global workforce. As work evolves and
                technology advances, these commitments remain our unwavering foundation.
                <br><br>
                Our mission is to organize the world's work. We will pursue this mission by
                building the most advanced process management platform while maintaining unwavering
                commitments to independence, universal access, and technical excellence.
            <br><br>
            To that end, we commit to the following principles:

                <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 mb-8">
                    We maintain absolute independence from external pressures that could compromise our primary obligation to
                    customer success. Our self-funded structure ensures that organizational needs remain our paramount concern,
                    free from the constraints of investor returns or market speculation.
                <br><br>
                Every strategic decision, from feature development to pricing architecture, is evaluated solely through the
                lens of customer value and long-term organizational benefit. This independence is not merely philosophical but
                structural. It is embedded in our governance and operational framework.

                    We reject the notion that all organizations should follow the same <em>"best practices."</em>  We recognize that operational excellence stems from differentiation, not standardization. While our industry
                    promotes rigid methodologies and prescriptive workflows, we believe that each organization's unique
                   processes constitute their competitive advantage.
               <br><br>
                    Blue adapts to your unique processes, not the other way around. We provide the foundation for you to build processes that reflect your organization's unique strengths, culture, and strategic advantages.

                    We are committed to eliminating the artificial barriers between enterprise capability and organizational

                    extensive IT budgets.
                <br><br>
                Every organization, from emerging startups to established enterprises, requires sophisticated tools to
