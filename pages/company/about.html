                    Hey there,
                </p>
                
                <p class="mb-6">
                    I'm Manny, the founder and CEO of Blue. I created Blue to address the challenges I faced while scaling my consultancy. Turns out — many people struggle to stay organized and streamline their business processes.
                </p>
                
                <p class="mb-6">
                    The central idea is that Blue is easy to use, so your team actually use it. We have all wasted money on software platforms that promised much but failed to deliver: they are rigid, awkward, and take forever to understand.
                </p>
                
                <p class="mb-6">
                    Blue is different — It's super easy to use, incredibly flexible, and yet powerful enough for serious work. And the great thing is that you don't have to change your processes! Blue adapts to your existing processes — giving you visibility, automations, and peace of mind. You'll sleep well at night knowing that nothing slips through the cracks.
                </p>
                
                <p class="mb-6">
                    So that's why I built Blue — because there is no company with a simple solution for scaling operations, without all the fluff.
                </p>
                
                <p class="mb-6">
                    Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy using Blue!
                </p>
                
                <p class="mb-8">
                    I know that we enjoy building it!
                </p>
                
                <p class="mb-6">
                    Stay productive,
                </p>
