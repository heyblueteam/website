GETTING STARTED
---------------
Q: What exactly is a workspace?
A: A workspace is a private container within Blue that houses all data, users, and processes for a specific purpose. Think of it as your own secure environment where you can build and manage any business process—from a sales CRM to an inventory system to a client portal.

Q: How many workspaces can I create?
A: There's no limit to the number of workspaces you can create. Whether you need separate workspaces for different departments, clients, projects, or business units, you can create as many as your organization requires.

Q: Can I customize what features are available in each workspace?
A: Yes! Each workspace can have different features enabled. You can toggle on/off records, forms, chat, docs, wiki, files, and other features to match the specific needs of each workspace. This keeps the interface clean and focused on what matters for each process.

DATA & SECURITY
---------------
Q: Is data truly isolated between workspaces?
A: Yes, workspaces provide complete data isolation. Information, files, and conversations in one workspace are never accessible from another workspace, even within the same Blue account. This ensures data privacy and security between different departments or clients.

Q: Can users access multiple workspaces?
A: Yes, users can be invited to multiple workspaces and switch between them easily. However, they only see data from the workspace they're currently in. Their permissions can be different in each workspace based on their role and responsibilities.

Q: How do permissions work within workspaces?
A: Each workspace has its own permission system. You can set granular permissions for what users can see and do within that specific workspace. Learn more about our comprehensive permission system on our user permissions page.

USE CASES
---------
Q: What are common use cases for multiple workspaces?
A: Organizations typically create workspaces for: different departments (Sales, HR, Operations), client projects (one workspace per client), business units or locations, different processes (recruiting, inventory, support tickets), or external collaboration with partners and vendors.

Q: Can I use workspaces for client portals?
A: Absolutely! Many customers create dedicated workspaces for each client, providing a branded portal where clients can access their projects, documents, and communications. This keeps client data completely separate while providing transparency.

Q: Should I use one large workspace or multiple smaller ones?
A: It depends on your needs. Use separate workspaces when you need data isolation (different clients or departments), different feature sets, or distinct user groups. Use a single workspace when teams need to collaborate closely and share information frequently.
