## List all Projects

The `projectList` query allows you to retrieve projects with powerful filtering, sorting, and pagination options.

### Basic Example

```graphql
query ProjectListQuery {
  projectList(filter: { companyIds: ["ENTER COMPANY ID"] }) {
    items {
      id
      uid
      slug
      name
      description
      archived
      color
      icon
      createdAt
      updatedAt
      allowNotification
      position
      unseenActivityCount
      todoListsMaxPosition
      lastAccessedAt
      isTemplate
      automationsCount
      totalFileCount
      totalFileSize
      todoAlias
    }
    pageInfo {
      totalPages
      totalItems
      page
      perPage
      hasNextPage
      hasPreviousPage
    }
  }
}
```

### Advanced Example with Filtering and Sorting

```graphql
query FilteredProjectList {
  projectList(
    filter: {
      companyIds: ["company-123", "company-456"]
      archived: false
      isTemplate: false
      search: "marketing"
      inProject: true
      folderId: null  # Get root-level projects only
    }
    sort: [position_ASC, name_ASC]
    skip: 0
    take: 50
  ) {
    items {
      id
      name
      slug
      position
      archived
    }
    totalCount
    pageInfo {
      totalItems
      hasNextPage
    }
  }
}
```

## Project Fields

The following table describes the fields returned for each project in the `ProjectListQuery`:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| id | Unique identifier for the project |
| uid | User-friendly unique identifier for the project |
| slug | URL-friendly name of the project |
| name | Display name of the project |
| description | Brief description of the project |
| archived | Boolean indicating if the project is archived |
| color | Color associated with the project for visual identification |
| icon | Icon associated with the project for visual identification |
| createdAt | Timestamp when the project was created |
| updatedAt | Timestamp when the project was last updated |
| allowNotification | Boolean indicating if notifications are enabled for the project |
| position | Numeric value representing the project's position in a list |
| unseenActivityCount | Number of unseen activities in the project |
| todoListsMaxPosition | Maximum position value for todo lists in the project |
| lastAccessedAt | Timestamp when the project was last accessed |
| isTemplate | Boolean indicating if the project is a template |
| automationsCount | Number of automations associated with the project |
| totalFileCount | Total number of files in the project |
| totalFileSize | Total size of all files in the project |
| todoAlias | Custom alias for "todo" used in the project |

## Pagination Fields

The `pageInfo` object provides pagination details for the query results:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| totalPages | Total number of pages of results |
| totalItems | Total number of projects matching the query |
| page | Current page number |
| perPage | Number of items per page |
| hasNextPage | Boolean indicating if there's a next page of results |
| hasPreviousPage | Boolean indicating if there's a previous page of results |

## Query Parameters

### Filter Options (ProjectListFilter)

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `companyIds` | [String!]! | ✅ Yes | Array of company IDs or slugs to search within |
| `ids` | [String!] | No | Filter by specific project IDs |
| `archived` | Boolean | No | Filter by archived status (true/false) |
| `isTemplate` | Boolean | No | Filter template projects (true/false) |
| `search` | String | No | Search projects by name (case-insensitive) |
| `folderId` | String | No | Filter by folder ID. Use `null` for root-level projects |
| `inProject` | Boolean | No | Filter by user membership. See note below |

**Note on `inProject` filter:**
- `true` or `undefined`: Returns projects the user is a member of
- `false`: Returns projects the user is NOT in (requires company owner permission)
- Folder filtering (`folderId`) only works when `inProject` is not `false`

### Sorting Options (ProjectSort)

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id_ASC` | Sort by ID ascending |
| `id_DESC` | Sort by ID descending |
| `name_ASC` | Sort by name ascending (A-Z) |
| `name_DESC` | Sort by name descending (Z-A) |
| `createdAt_ASC` | Sort by creation date (oldest first) |
| `createdAt_DESC` | Sort by creation date (newest first) |
| `updatedAt_ASC` | Sort by last update (oldest first) |
| `updatedAt_DESC` | Sort by last update (newest first) |
| `position_ASC` | Sort by position ascending* |
| `position_DESC` | Sort by position descending* |

*Position sorting is only available when viewing projects the user is a member of (`inProject !== false`)

### Pagination Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `skip` | Int | 0 | Number of records to skip |
| `take` | Int | 20 | Number of records to return |

### Important Notes

1. **Default behavior for non-member projects** (`inProject: false`):
   - Excludes archived projects unless `archived` filter is explicitly set
   - Excludes template projects unless `isTemplate` filter is explicitly set
   
2. **Folder filtering limitations**:
   - Only works when showing user's projects
   - Cannot be used with `inProject: false`
   - Use `folderId: null` to get projects not in any folder

3. **Sorting fallback**:
   - Position sorting is ignored when viewing non-member projects
   - Falls back to name sorting in such cases

4. **Deprecated parameters**:
   - `orderBy`, `after`, `before`, `first`, `last` are deprecated
   - Use `sort`, `skip`, and `take` instead
