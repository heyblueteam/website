## Copy a Project

The copy project mutation allows you to duplicate an existing project within the same company or to a different company. This is useful for creating project templates, setting up similar projects, or moving projects between companies. The copy operation runs asynchronously to handle large projects efficiently.

### Basic Example

```graphql
mutation CopyProject {
  copyProject(
    input: {
      projectId: "proj_123abc"
      name: "New Project Copy"
      options: {
        todos: true
        todoLists: true
        people: true
      }
    }
  )
}
```

### Advanced Example

```graphql
mutation CopyProject {
  copyProject(
    input: {
      projectId: "proj_123abc"
      name: "Q2 Marketing Campaign"
      description: "Copy of Q1 campaign with updated timeline"
      imageURL: "https://example.com/campaign-logo.png"
      companyId: "comp_789xyz"
      options: {
        assignees: true
        automations: true
        checklists: true
        customFields: true
        discussions: false
        discussionComments: false
        dueDates: true
        files: true
        forms: true
        people: true
        projectUserRoles: true
        statusUpdates: false
        statusUpdateComments: false
        tags: true
        todoActions: true
        todoComments: false
        todoLists: true
        todos: true
      }
    }
  )
}
```

## Response

The mutation returns a `Boolean` value:
- `true` - The copy job has been successfully queued
- `false` - The copy job could not be started

## Checking Copy Status

Since copying is asynchronous, use the `copyProjectStatus` query to check progress:

```graphql
query CheckCopyStatus {
  copyProjectStatus {
    queuePosition
    progressPercentage
    project {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

## Required Permissions

To copy a project, you need appropriate permissions in both the source and target locations:

| Scenario | Required Permissions |
|----------|---------------------|
| Copy within same company | `OWNER`, `ADMIN`, or `MEMBER` role in the source project |
| Copy to different company | • `OWNER`, `ADMIN`, or `MEMBER` role in the source project<br>• Must be a member of the target company |

The source project must be active (not archived) to be copied.

## Error Responses

### Project Not Found
```json
{
  "errors": [{
    "message": "Record not found",
    "extensions": {
      "code": "PROJECT_NOT_FOUND"
    }
  }]
}
```
Occurs when the source project doesn't exist or you lack access.

### Company Not Found
```json
{
  "errors": [{
    "message": "Record not found",
    "extensions": {
      "code": "COMPANY_NOT_FOUND"
    }
  }]
}
```
Occurs when the target company doesn't exist or you lack access.

### Project Too Large
```json
{
  "errors": [{
    "message": "Project is too large to copy",
    "extensions": {
      "code": "CREATE_PROJECT_LIMIT"
    }
  }]
}
```
Occurs when the project has more than 250,000 tasks.

### Copy Already In Progress
```json
{
  "errors": [{
    "message": "Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again."
  }]
}
```
Occurs when you already have a copy operation in progress.

## Important Notes

- **Asynchronous Operation**: The mutation queues a background job and returns immediately. Use `copyProjectStatus` to track progress.
- **One Copy at a Time**: Only one copy operation per user can be active at any time.
- **Size Limitations**: Projects with more than 250,000 tasks cannot be copied.
- **Logical Dependencies**: Some options depend on others:
  - `assignees` requires `people: true`
  - `discussionComments` requires `discussions: true`
  - `statusUpdateComments` requires `statusUpdates: true`
  - `projectUserRoles` requires `people: true`
- **Name Processing**: Project names are trimmed and any URLs are automatically removed.
- **Queue Priority**: Enterprise customers receive higher priority in the copy queue.
- **Status Caching**: Copy status is cached for 6 hours after completion.
