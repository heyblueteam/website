Archiving projects is useful when you want to temporarily remove a project from the list of projects without deleting it. Archived projects are not editable but can be viewed by the anyone who is in the project. An archived project can be unarchived at any time.

To archive a project, you can use the following mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  archiveProject
}
``` 



::callout
