You'll likely have supporting files and documents during a project or process. These could be work-in-progress design files, word documents for review, pictures, and videos.

Blue offers generous file storage, [in line with our fair-use policies](https://www.blue.cc/legal/terms), for all your project and process-related needs. The maximum file size for an individual file is 5GB.

## Uploading in Comments

You can upload files anywhere where you can write a comment; the files are shown inline with your text instead of attachments to your message. We believe this is important so that everyone has the precise context of your message with the data at their fingertips.

![File Management 1](/docs/FileManagement_1.png "File Management 1")

Blue puts your files right into the context — not hidden away.

The file will also be shown in the files tab.  Note that if the original comment where the uploaded file is deleted, the file is also deleted from the files tab.

**Files in Record Descriptions** <br/> <br/>
Files uploaded in the description area of the records are not listed in the files tab, as these are typically used for temporary notes. We recommend uploading files to a [specific file custom field](/docs/custom-fields/introduction/file) instead.
::

## File Custom Field

Blue has a [specific custom file field for handling structured data uploads](/docs/custom-fields/introduction/file). Files uploaded in this field will show on the file tab in the project and can be deleted from both the custom field within the record and the files tab.

For supported file types, such as most images, videos, and PDF documents. You can right-click to preview the file without downloading it to your device.

**File deletion is permanent.** <br/> <br/>
It's important to note that when you delete a file in Blue, it's permanently deleted from our systems. We keep rolling 30-day backups for all active files and have redundant storage capacity to ensure that we never lose any of your files.
::

## Files Tab

Every project has a file tab, which shows all the files uploaded in any comment in the project and any additional files uploaded directly in the files tab.

### Grid & List View

You can choose between two ways to view your files in the files tab.

![File Management 6](/docs/FileManagement_6.gif "File Management 6")

### Searching for Files

You can search for files by their name using the file search bar. This will instantly search across all files in all folders and sub-folders.

### Sharing Files

On Blue, you can share files publicly and generate a downloadable link for anyone to access them. Here's how:

1. Navigate to the files you want to share.
2. Select the file by clicking on them.
3. Click the "Share" button.
4. A unique, shareable link will be generated for the selected file.
5. Copy and share this link with the intended recipients.
6. Once they have downloaded the files, you can disable the sharing option to maintain the security of the file.

This feature allows you to share files publicly with ease, while also giving you control over revoking access when necessary. Just remember to disable sharing after the files have been obtained to protect your data.

You can create unlimited amounts of folders and sub-folders to match your organisational file structure.
