## Create a New Project
To create a new project, you can use the following mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  createProject(
    input: {
      name: "YOUR PROJECT NEW NAME"
      companyId: "YOUR COMPANY ID OR SLUG"
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

::callout

Remember to include the required headers in your request:
- `X-Bloo-Token-ID`: Your API token ID
- `X-Bloo-Token-Secret`: Your API token secret
- `X-Bloo-Company-ID`: Your company ID
- `Content-Type: application/json`
::

The `CreateProjectInput` should include the following fields:

- name (required): The name of the new project.
- companyId (required): The ID of the company under which the project will be created.

Upon success, the mutation will return the ID of the newly created project:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "createProject": {
      "id": "newly-created-project-id"
    }
  }
}
```



## Create from a Template

To create a project from an existing template, you can add an optional `templateId` to the mutation. 

```graphql
mutation {
  createProject(
    input: {
      templateId: "YOUR TEMPLATE ID OR SLUG"
      name: "YOUR PROJECT NEW NAME"
      companyId: "YOUR COMPANY ID OR SLUG"
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```


::callout

Creating a project from a template will not create the project instantly. Instead, your project creation will be queued.
::

## Check Creation Status

To check the status of your project creation in the queue, you can use the following query:

```graphql
query {
  copyProjectStatus {
    newProjectName
    isTemplate
    isActive
    queuePosition
    totalQueues
  }
}
```

This query will return the status of your project creation in the queue.
