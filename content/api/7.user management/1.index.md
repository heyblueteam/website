## Invite a User

The `inviteUser` mutation allows you to invite users to your Blue projects or companies. Users can be assigned predefined access levels or custom roles with specific permissions.

### Basic Example

Invite a user with a standard access level:

```graphql
mutation InviteUserToProject {
  inviteUser(
    input: {
      email: "newuser@example.com"
      projectId: "web-redesign"
      accessLevel: MEMBER
    }
  )
}
```

### Advanced Example

Invite a user with a custom role to multiple projects:

```graphql
mutation InviteUserWithCustomRole {
  inviteUser(
    input: {
      email: "contractor@example.com"
      projectIds: ["web-redesign", "mobile-app", "api-v2"]
      accessLevel: MEMBER
      roleId: "role_contractor_123"
    }
  )
}
```

## Input Parameters

### InviteUserInput

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

## Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |

| `success` | Boolean! | Whether the invitation was sent successfully |

## Required Permissions

Users must have sufficient permissions to invite others. The permission hierarchy is enforced:

| Your Role | Can Invite |
|-----------|------------|
| `OWNER` | ✅ All access levels |
| `ADMIN` | ✅ All except OWNER |
| `MEMBER` | ✅ MEMBER, CLIENT, COMMENT_ONLY, VIEW_ONLY |
| `CLIENT` | ✅ CLIENT only |
| `COMMENT_ONLY` | ❌ Cannot invite |
| `VIEW_ONLY` | ❌ Cannot invite |

## Custom Roles

When using custom roles:
1. Set `accessLevel` to `MEMBER`
2. Provide the `roleId` of your custom role
3. The user will inherit all permissions defined in the custom role

To retrieve available custom roles, use the `projectUserRoles` [query](/api/user-management/retrieve-custom-role).

## Important Notes

- **Email Validation**: Email addresses are normalized and validated before sending invitations
- **Invitation Expiry**: Invitations expire after 7 days and must be resent if not accepted
- **Automatic Notifications**: Blue automatically sends invitation emails to new users
- **Company Owners**: Company owners automatically receive ADMIN access in all projects
- **Billing Impact**: Adding users may affect your subscription if you have per-user pricing
- **Activity Logging**: All user invitations are logged for audit purposes
