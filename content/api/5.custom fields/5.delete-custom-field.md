## Delete a Custom Field

Permanently removes a custom field from a project along with all associated data, values, and configurations. This operation cannot be undone and will affect all records that use this field.

### Basic Example

```graphql
mutation DeleteCustomField {
  deleteCustomField(id: "field_abc123")
}
```

### Advanced Example

```graphql
mutation DeleteCustomFieldWithResponse {
  deleteCustomField(id: "field_abc123")
}
```

## Input Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | String! | ✅ Yes | The unique identifier of the custom field to delete |

## Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `deleteCustomField` | Boolean! | Always returns `true` when deletion succeeds |

## Required Permissions

Only project owners and administrators can delete custom fields.

| Role | Can Delete Custom Fields |
|------|-------------------------|
| `OWNER` | ✅ Yes |
| `ADMIN` | ✅ Yes |
| `MEMBER` | ❌ No |
| `CLIENT` | ❌ No |

## Cascading Effects

When a custom field is deleted, the following cleanup operations occur automatically:

### Data Cleanup
- **Custom field values** - All values for this field are removed from all records
- **Field options** - All dropdown options and configurations are deleted
- **Activity history** - All activity records related to this field are removed
- **Lookup configurations** - Any lookup field references are cleaned up

### Special Handling for Button Fields
If the deleted field is of type `BUTTON`, additional cleanup occurs:
- **Automations** - All automations triggered by this button are deleted
- **Automation history** - Related automation activity is removed

### Real-time Updates
- **Charts** - Project charts are marked for update to reflect the changes
- **Formulas** - All formula fields in the project are recalculated
- **Time tracking** - Time duration calculations are updated
- **Subscriptions** - Real-time notifications are sent to connected clients
- **Webhooks** - Integration webhooks are triggered with deletion events

## Error Responses

### Custom Field Not Found
```json
{
  "errors": [{
    "message": "Custom field was not found.",
    "extensions": {
      "code": "CUSTOM_FIELD_NOT_FOUND"
    }
  }]
}
```

### Insufficient Permissions
```json
{
  "errors": [{
    "message": "You don't have permission to perform this action",
    "extensions": {
      "code": "FORBIDDEN"
    }
  }]
}
```

### Project Not Active
```json
{
  "errors": [{
    "message": "Project is not active",
    "extensions": {
      "code": "PROJECT_NOT_ACTIVE"
    }
  }]
}
```

## Important Notes

### Permanent Deletion
- **No undo** - Deleted custom fields cannot be recovered
- **Data loss** - All field values across all records are permanently removed
- **Immediate effect** - Changes take effect immediately across all project users

### Performance Considerations
- **Large projects** - Deletion may take longer in projects with many records
- **Formula recalculation** - Projects with complex formulas may experience brief processing delays
- **Chart updates** - Dashboard charts will refresh to reflect the changes

### Best Practices
1. **Backup data** - Export important field values before deletion
2. **Communicate changes** - Notify team members before deleting fields
3. **Check dependencies** - Verify no automations or formulas depend on the field
4. **Review reports** - Update any reports that reference the deleted field

### Related Operations
- Use [List Custom Fields](/api/custom-fields/list-custom-fields) to find field IDs
- Consider [Create Custom Field](/api/custom-fields/create-custom-fields) to recreate similar fields
- Review [Custom Field Values](/api/custom-fields/custom-field-values) to understand data impact

## Common Use Cases

### Removing Unused Fields
```graphql
# First, list fields to identify unused ones
query ListCustomFields {
  customFields(projectId: "project_123") {
    id
    name
    type
    createdAt
    # Check usage in records
  }
}

# Then delete the unused field
mutation DeleteUnusedField {
  deleteCustomField(id: "field_to_remove")
}
```

### Cleaning Up Test Fields
```graphql
# Remove fields created during testing
mutation CleanupTestFields {
  field1: deleteCustomField(id: "test_field_1")
  field2: deleteCustomField(id: "test_field_2")
  field3: deleteCustomField(id: "test_field_3")
}
```

### Restructuring Project Fields
```graphql
# When reorganizing field structure
mutation RestructureFields {
  # Delete old fields
  deleteOldPriorityField: deleteCustomField(id: "old_priority_field")
  deleteOldStatusField: deleteCustomField(id: "old_status_field")
  
  # Note: Create new fields in separate mutations
}
```

## Webhook Events

When a custom field is deleted, the following webhook event is triggered:

```json
{
  "event": "CUSTOM_FIELD_DELETED",
  "projectId": "project_123",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "previousValue": {
    "id": "field_abc123",
    "name": "Priority Level",
    "type": "SELECT_SINGLE",
    "projectId": "project_123"
  },
  "currentValue": null
}
```
