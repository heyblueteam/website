Blue [has had an API with 100% feature coverage for years.](/platform/api), allowing you to pull data like project lists and records, or post new information into Blue. But what if you want your own system to receive updates when something changes in Blue? That's where webhooks come in.

Instead of constantly querying the Blue API to check for updates, Blue can now proactively notify your platform when new events occur.

However, implementing webhooks effectively can be challenging.

## A Fresh Approach to Webhooks

Many platforms offer a one-size-fits-all webhook that sends data for all event types, leaving it up to you and your team to sift through the information and extract what's relevant. 

At Blue, we asked ourselves: **Could there be a better way? How can we make our webhooks as developer-friendly as possible?**

Our solution? 

Precise control! 

With Blue, you can choose *exactly* which events, or *combination*s of events, will trigger a webhook. You can also specify which projects, or *combinations* of projects (even across different companies!), the events should occur in. 

This level of granularity in unprecedented, and it allows you to receive only the data you need, when you need it.

## Reliability and Ease of Use

We've built intelligence into our webhook system to ensure reliability. 

Blue automatically monitors the health of your webhook connections and employs smart retry logic, attempting delivery up to five times before deactivating a webhook. This helps prevent data loss and reduces the need for manual intervention.

Setting up webhooks in Blue is straightforward. 

You can configure them through our API for programmatic setup, or use our web application for a user-friendly interface. This flexibility allows both developers and non-technical users to harness the power of webhooks.

## Real-Time Data, Endless Possibilities

By leveraging Blue's webhooks, you can create real-time integrations between Blue and your other business systems. This opens up a world of possibilities for automation, data synchronization, and custom workflows. Whether you're updating a CRM, triggering alerts, or feeding data into analytics tools, Blue's webhooks provide the real-time connection you need.
