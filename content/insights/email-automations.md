One of the key benefits of email automations in Blue is the ability to personalize the content using merge tags. When customizing the email subject and body, you can insert merge tags that reference specific record data, such as the record name or custom field values. Simply use the {curly bracket} syntax to insert merge tags.

You can also include file attachments by dragging and dropping them into the email or using the attachment icon. Files from File custom fields may automatically attach if they are under 10MB.

Before finalizing your email automation, it’s recommended to send a test email to yourself or a colleague to ensure everything is functioning as intended.

## Use Cases and Examples

Email automations in Blue can be used for a variety of purposes. Here are a few examples:

1. Send a confirmation email when a client submits a request via an intake form. Set the trigger to send an email when a new record is created through the form, and make sure to include an email field in the form to capture the client’s address.
2. Notify an assignee when a new high-priority task is created. Set the trigger to send an email when a “Priority” tag is added to a record, and use the {Assignee} merge tag to automatically send the email to the assigned user.
3. Send a survey to a customer after a support ticket is marked as resolved. Set the trigger to send an email when a record is marked as completed and moved to the “Done” list. Include the customer’s email in a custom field and provide detailed information about the resolved issue in the email body.
4. Automate a recruitment program by sending confirmation emails to applicants. Set the trigger to send an email when an application is submitted through a form and added to the “Received” list. Capture the applicant’s email in the form, and use it to send a thank-you response.
