title: Cover Images
description: Display visual previews on your records by automatically extracting images from descriptions, comments, or custom fields.
---

## Overview

Cover images allow you to add visual context to your records by displaying image previews directly on record cards. This feature automatically extracts images from various sources within your records and displays them as thumbnails, making it easier to identify and organize visual content at a glance.

Whether you're managing design projects, content calendars, product catalogs, or any workflow involving visual assets, cover images help you quickly scan through records and find what you're looking for.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Image Extraction**: Blue automatically finds and displays images from your chosen source
- **Multiple Image Sources**: Pull images from record descriptions, comments, or custom file fields
- **Flexible Display Options**: Choose how images fit within the preview area
- **Smart Selection**: Configure whether to use the first, last, or a specific image
- **Real-time Updates**: Cover images update automatically when record content changes
- **Bulk Processing**: Generate covers for all existing records with progress tracking

Cover images make your records instantly recognizable

## How It Works

### Enabling Cover Images

Cover images are configured at the project level by Project Administrators:

1. Open your project and navigate to **Project Settings**
2. Select **Record Settings** 
3. Find the **Image Cover Options** section
4. Toggle **Enable Cover Images** to activate the feature

### Configuration Options

#### Image Source
Choose where Blue should look for images:
- **Description**: Extracts images embedded in record descriptions (default)
- **Comments**: Pulls the first/last image from record comments
- **Custom Field**: Uses files from a specific file-type custom field

#### Image Selection
When multiple images are available, choose which to display:
- **First Image**: Uses the first image found (default)
- **Last Image**: Uses the most recent image
- **Specific**: Choose a specific position (coming soon)

#### Display Fit
Control how images appear in the preview area:
- **Cover**: Image fills the entire preview area, may crop edges (default)
- **Contain**: Shows the complete image, may have empty space

Configure cover images to match your workflow needs

## Use Cases

**Design Projects** - Display mockups and design iterations directly on task cards, making it easy to see the current state of each design task without opening individual records.

**Content Planning** - For content calendars and editorial workflows, show featured images or thumbnails to visualize your content pipeline at a glance.

**Product Management** - Display product photos on inventory records or feature requests, helping teams quickly identify items during discussions.

**Real Estate** - Show property photos on listing records, allowing agents to quickly browse through properties visually.

**Event Planning** - Display venue photos, design concepts, or event layouts on planning tasks for better visual organization.

## Setting Up Cover Images

### Step 1: Choose Your Image Source

Consider where images naturally exist in your workflow:
- If images are part of task descriptions or briefs, use **Description**
- If images are added through team collaboration, use **Comments**
- If you have a dedicated field for images, use **Custom Field**

### Step 2: Configure Display Settings

1. Select your preferred **Image Fit** based on your image types:
   - Use **Cover** for photos and designs where cropping is acceptable
   - Use **Contain** for diagrams or screenshots where you need to see everything

2. Choose **Image Selection** based on your workflow:
   - Use **First** for workflows where the primary image is added initially
   - Use **Last** for workflows where the most recent image is most relevant

### Step 3: Process Existing Records

When you first enable cover images, Blue will process your existing records:
1. A progress indicator will appear showing processing status
2. Records are processed in batches for optimal performance
3. You can continue working while processing happens in the background
4. Lists will automatically refresh when processing completes

Track progress as Blue generates covers for existing records

## Best Practices

### Image Quality
- Use high-quality images that look good as thumbnails
- Ensure images have good contrast for visibility at small sizes
- Consider using consistent image dimensions for uniform appearance

### Performance
- Cover images use lazy loading for fast list performance
- Thumbnails are automatically optimized for quick loading
- Original images remain unchanged and accessible

### Organization
- Use consistent image placement across similar records
- Consider creating a custom file field specifically for cover images
- Establish team guidelines for which images to use

## Technical Details

### Supported Formats
- JPEG/JPG images
- PNG images (including transparency)
- Images must be uploaded to Blue (external URLs not supported)

### Limitations
- Maximum 6,000 records per project for bulk cover generation
- Only file-type custom fields can be used as sources
- Cover images are view-only and cannot be edited directly

### Automatic Updates
Covers automatically regenerate when:
- Record description is edited (if using Description source)
- New comments with images are added (if using Comments source)  
- Files in custom fields are updated (if using Custom Field source)
- Cover configuration settings are changed

**Performance Tip** <br/> 
For projects with thousands of records, consider enabling cover images during off-peak hours. While processing happens in the background and doesn't block your work, initial generation can take time for large projects.

## Integration with Other Features

Cover images work seamlessly with other Blue features:
- **[Forms](/docs/projects/forms)**: Submitted images can automatically become covers
- **[API](/docs/integrations/api)**: Access cover image data programmatically

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Appearing
- Verify images are in supported formats (JPEG/PNG)
- Check that images are uploaded to Blue, not external links
- Ensure the selected source contains images

### Wrong Image Displayed
- Review your Image Selection setting (First vs Last)
- Check if multiple images exist in the source
- Verify the correct custom field is selected

### Processing Takes Too Long
- Projects with over 6,000 records cannot use bulk generation
- Try processing during off-peak hours
- Contact support if processing seems stuck

Cover images transform your Blue workspace into a visual command center, making it easier than ever to manage visual content and quickly identify records at a glance.
