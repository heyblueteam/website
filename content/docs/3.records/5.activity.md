They serve as a comprehensive audit trail that documents every modification, ensuring clarity and accountability in record management.

Record activity is meticulously logged.

Each entry in the activity log captures the specifics of what was changed, who made the change, and when it occurred. This level of detail extends to all aspects of a record, including changes made to custom fields. Every action is meticulously logged, whether it's an update to a [custom field value](/public/docs/custom-fields), a status change, or a modification in the [record's assignment](/public/docs/records/assignees).

One of the critical features of these logs is their immutability. **Activity logs cannot be altered**, which upholds the integrity and accuracy of the record's history.

An example of changing a record name

If an action recorded in the log is reversed or changed, the log doesn’t erase the original entry. Instead, it adds a new entry to document the reversal. This approach ensures that the activity log provides a complete and uneditable history of all changes, preserving the record's integrity over time.

The detailed nature of these logs is invaluable for various purposes:

- **Accountability**: By tracking who made each change, the logs foster accountability among team members.
- **Audit and Compliance**: The logs serve as a crucial tool for audit trails and compliance, especially in environments where tracking data changes is mandatory.
- **Project Management and Review**: They enable project managers and team members to review the progression of a record, understand decision-making processes, and analyze workflow efficiency.

You can toggle between showing comments + activity, only comments, and only activity based on what's important to you. Blue remembers your preference across all records, and you can switch your preference within any record.
