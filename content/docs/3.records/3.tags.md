description: Tags offer a robust, flexible system to categorize records

Tags are a useful way to organize your work. You can use them to show different task types, urgency, or any category that fits your project. Each tag can be color-coded for easy identification and to add some color to your workspace.

You can color code tags to make them stand out:

![Tag 1](/public/docs/Tag_1.png "Tags")

And here's two tags showing on a record card


![Tag 2](/public/docs/Tag_2.png "Tags")


## Using Tags

- **Adding Tags**: To create a tag, consider the aspects of your tasks that need categorization—be it the nature of the task, such as 'bug', 'back-end', or 'UI', or its priority. Once you've identified your categories, you can easily create tags and assign them unique colors for immediate recognition.
- **Filtering with Tags**: Blue’s filtering capabilities make managing your workload more intuitive. You can filter tags using the drop-down Filter icon or directly within the board view by clicking on the desired tag.

Cross-Project Tagging <br/>
For organisation-wide views such as Dashboards and maps, tagging becomes especially important because Blue automatically merges tags of the same name. So you just need to filter by "Priority 1" tag, which will show only records across all projects with that tag.
