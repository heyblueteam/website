Repeating tasks in Blue provides several key benefits:

- **Save Time**: Automates repetitive tasks so you don't have to manually recreate the same record over and over. This is great for recurring meetings, reports, newsletters etc. Saves having to rebuild agendas/documents every time.
- **Consistency**: Ensures recurring processes follow the same structure by automatically carrying over checklists, custom fields, etc. Maintains continuity for recurring meetings or communications by copying over attendees, descriptions etc.
- **Planning Ahead**: Enables preparation for upcoming recurring tasks well in advance. Can provide team visibility into future workload demands from repeating records
