description: Blue has a beautiful full-featured kanban board view to support process-based work.
---

The Board is the default view in Blue, providing a flexible kanban-style project board. Lists represent different stages or steps in a process, enabling users to map out workflows visually.

The Board View is commonly used for:

- Project management — Mapping out project stages from backlog to completion
- Sales pipelines — Tracking deal stages from lead to closed
- Hiring processes — Visualizing applicant stages from sourced to hired

## Lists as Process Steps

Lists on the board represent major steps in a process. Typical configurations involve stages progressing left to right, from early to late stages. List names clearly indicate the specific stage.

Records can be dragged between lists to advance them through different process steps.

## Record Cards

Record cards provide key details like title, assignee(s), due date, tags, and description. Cards can be dragged to reorder them within a list.

Users can quickly create records by clicking "+ Add Record" at the top or bottom of any list.
