## Pin & Track

On the record:

- **Pin on the go**: Use the location icon to pin your current location instantly.

- **Location Tracking**: The Map leverages the [Location/Map custom field](/public/docs/custom-fields/location-map) to pull in latitude and longitude data associated with records.

- **Visual Identification**: Map pins are color-coded based on the record's primary tag, enabling intuitive recognition.

On the Map:

- **Detail Popups**: Clicking a pin reveals a popup with the record's name, project, list, tags, and assignees. Click again to open the full record.

## Google Maps

Blue also supports using Google Maps for the map view instead of the default OpenStreetMap. Google maps often has more detailed maps of certain areas and more accurate location data. However, this requires a Google Maps API key and has to be entered in the company settings by the company owner. 

**Use Cases**

The Map view unlocks unique perspectives across use cases:

- Plot customer, partner or asset locations
- Visualize service regions, sales territories or market areas
- Track shipment origins and destinations
- Map event venues, job sites or inventory warehouses
- Identify facility locations for operations analysis
- Monitor field employee positions
- Pinpoint geographical assets and points of interest

With interactive navigation and built-in location tracking, the Map View surfaces new dimensions within your data.
