Email automations allow you to automatically send emails when certain triggers occur, using data stored within your Blue records. For example, sending a confirmation email when a new record is created or notifying a manager when a task becomes overdue.

## Configuration

Getting started with email automations is straightforward. When you first create an automation, we recommend sending a test email to yourself or a colleague. This allows you to validate that the automation is functioning before rolling out.

To create an email automation:

- Set the trigger, such as
  - A New Record is Created
  - A Tag is added to a Record
  - A Record is Moved to Another List

Once you've set up for when something happen Then "Send Email"

Now it's time to Configure the email details:

- From name and reply-to address so recipients can respond.
- To address (can be static or pulled dynamically from an [Email custom field](/public/docs/custom-fields/email))
- Enter your own email address or a test email in the recipient field. If you want to loop in others, you can also add CC or BCC email addresses.

Next, customize the email content using merge tags:

- Email subject and body content using custom field for dynamic content using merge tags.
- Click inside the email body, then insert merge tags referencing record names, custom fields etc. using the {curly bracket} syntax.
- Insert file attachments by drag-and-drop or using the attachment icon. Files from File custom fields may automatically attach if under 10MB.

Once you finish customizing the template, confirm creation of the automation. When triggered, it will now send personalized emails leveraging your record data.
