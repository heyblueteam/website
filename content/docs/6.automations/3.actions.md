Actions are the operations that Blue performs automatically when an automation is triggered. Once a trigger condition is met, actions execute specific tasks to streamline your workflow.

## Available Actions

Blue provides a comprehensive set of actions that can be combined to create powerful automations:

### Task Management Actions
- **Change Todo List**: Move a record to a different list within the project
- **Mark as Complete**: Automatically mark a record as done
- **Mark as Incomplete**: Revert a record back to incomplete status
- **Copy Todo**: Create a duplicate of the record with specified options

### Assignment Actions
- **Add Assignee**: Assign one or more team members to a record
- **Remove Assignee**: Remove specific assignees from a record

### Date Management Actions
- **Change Due Date**: Set or update the due date of a record
- **Remove Due Date**: Clear the due date from a record

### Organization Actions
- **Add Tag**: Apply tags to categorize and organize records
- **Remove Tag**: Remove specific tags from records
- **Add Color**: Apply color coding to records for visual organization
- **Remove Color**: Remove color coding from records

### Checklist Actions
- **Mark Checklist Item as Done**: Complete specific checklist items
- **Mark Checklist Item as Undone**: Revert checklist items to incomplete
- **Create Checklist**: Add new checklists with items to records

### Custom Field Actions
- **Add Custom Field**: Set values for custom fields on records
- **Remove Custom Field**: Clear custom field values

### Communication Actions
- **[Send Email](/docs/automations/actions/email-automations)**: Send automated emails with record data
- **Generate PDF**: Create PDF documents from portable document templates
- **Make HTTP Request**: Integrate with external services via webhooks

## How Actions Work

Actions can be chained together to create complex workflows. For example, when a record is marked complete, you could:
1. Move it to a "Completed" list
2. Send a notification email to the client
3. Create a follow-up task
4. Update a custom field with the completion date

## Action Configuration

Each action type has specific configuration options:
- **Target Selection**: Choose which records or users are affected
- **Conditional Logic**: Set conditions for when actions should execute
- **Data Mapping**: Use merge tags to include dynamic data from records
- **Timing**: Some actions support delays or scheduled execution

## Best Practices

1. **Test First**: Always test automations with sample data before enabling
2. **Start Simple**: Begin with single actions and add complexity gradually
3. **Document Purpose**: Use clear naming to describe what each automation does
4. **Monitor Results**: Review automation logs to ensure expected behavior
5. **Avoid Conflicts**: Be careful not to create actions that undo each other

## Permissions

Only Project Administrators can create and modify automation actions. All team members can view active automations to understand the project's workflow.
