**Use Case Scenario: High-Tech Electronics Retailer**

A high-tech electronics retailer utilizes Blue to optimize their inventory management system, addressing challenges such as overstocking and stock shortages. By setting up dedicated inventory projects on Blue, the retailer efficiently manages its diverse range of products—from smartphones to laptops and accessories.

- **Stock In/Out Tracking**: The retailer creates two main projects on Blue, "Stock In" for incoming inventory from suppliers and "Stock Out" for items sold or transferred between stores. Each product entry is accompanied by a formula field to automatically calculate stock levels based on sales data and incoming shipments.
- **Product Categorization with Tags**: Through the use of tags, the retailer categorizes inventory by type (e.g., smartphones, laptops), brand, and price range, enabling quick access to stock information and simplifying the inventory search process.
- **Dashboard Monitoring**: A comprehensive dashboard on Blue provides real-time insights into stock levels, with visual indicators for low-stock items and alerts for restocking needs.
- **Inventory Management Assignment**: Specific team members are assigned to manage different segments of the inventory, such as high-value items or fast-moving goods.
