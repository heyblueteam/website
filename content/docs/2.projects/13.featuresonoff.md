Project administrators can turn features on or off for a project for all users. This is useful if you want to limit the features available to a project. For instance, not all projects may need to have the Wiki enabled. Administrators can also rarrange the order of the tabs in the project.

Limiting features in a project can also be done on a user group level using [custom user roles](/public/docs/user-management/roles/custom-user-roles).
