Store financial information in the currency field

When adding currency values, the field will format the number according to local conventions and display the relevant currency symbol. For example, $1,000.50 for US Dollars or €1.500,25 for Euros.

The currency field validates entries to ensure only valid currency amounts are captured. Once added to a project, the field will store amounts in the singular designated currency type. It does not provide automated currency conversion between multiple denominations.

This field delivers an optimized experience for tracking monetary data associated with records. The automated formatting removes the complexity of manually entering currency values in local formats, while validation protects data integrity.

Potential uses for the currency field include:

- Capturing transaction amounts
- Storing project budgets
- Tracking invoice totals
- Recording payment amounts
- Calculating revenue

With robust support for global currency formats and streamlined data entry, the Currency custom field enables you to centralize key financial information within your records in Blue.
