Lookup custom fields allow you to import data from records in other projects, creating one-way visibility. While [Reference custom fields](/public/docs/custom-fields/reference) establish connections across projects, Lookups use those connections to surface selected data.

Lookup custom fields are always read-only and are connected to a specific Reference custom field. When a user selects one or more records using a Reference custom field, the Lookup custom field will show data from those records.

Lookups can show data such as:

- **Created at**: When the referenced record was created.
- **Updated at**: The last date and time when the referenced record was updated in any way.
- **Due Date**: The reference record's start/due date and time.
- **Description**: The description field of the referenced record.
- **List**: Shows the list that the referenced record belongs to.
- **Tag**: Any tags that the referenced record is tagged with.
- **Assignee**: Any assignees to the referenced record.
- **Any Custom Field**: Any supported custom field from the referenced record.

Lookup fields have many options 

## Lookup a Lookup

You can create custom fields to store and reference data across multiple different projects. These custom fields are called "Lookup" fields.

Let's consider three projects:

- **Project A**
- **Project B**
- **Project C**

Suppose Project B contains some critical information or resources that are relevant to both Project A and Project C.

Instead of duplicating the information from Project B into Project A and Project C, follow these steps:

- In Project A, create a "Reference" custom field to establish a connection with the relevant record from Project B.

  - This Reference custom field allows you to select and link to the specific record in Project B that you want to reference and lookup.

- Once the Reference field is set up in Project A, create a "Lookup" custom field in Project C.

  - This Lookup custom field will be connected to the Reference custom field in Project A.

  - When you select records using the Reference custom field in Project A, the Lookup custom field in Project C will automatically display relevant data from those referenced records in Project B.

## Benefits of using Lookup a Lookup:

- You don't need to directly link Project C to Project B.
- Project C can leverage the connection established between Project A and Project B through the Reference and Lookup fields.
- Any changes or updates made to the relevant records in Project B will automatically reflect in the Lookup custom field data displayed in Project C.
- No need for manual updates or duplication of information across projects.
