- Pinpointing event venues, job sites, or asset locations for field operations
- Tracking shipment origins and destinations in supply chain workflows
- Mapping real estate listings for properties available for sale or rent
- Identifying hospital, clinic, or care home addresses in healthcare systems
- Locating equipment deployment sites for installation and maintenance workflows
- Showing branch or facility locations for internal operations and analysis

## Adding Locations

When adding a location, users can either:

- Manually enter latitude and longitude coordinates
- Search for an address or location name, which will auto-populate the coordinates
- Click on the map to drop a pin and select the desired location

Records containing a location can be viewed collectively on the [Map view](https://claude.ai/views/map.md) in Blue. On the Map, the pin color for each record corresponds to the color of its primary tag.
