Zapier is an integration platform that helps connect different web apps and automate workflows.

**Use Cases**

Here are some of the most popular ways Blue is integrated with other apps via Zapier:

**_Sync Blue Records to Google Sheets_**

As Blue records are created or updated, automatically append them as new rows in a Google Sheet for centralized reporting.

**_Send Order Confirmation from Blue records_**

When you select certain custom field on Blue, automatically send out email to confirm order with your customer.

**_Add Blue Comments to Slack_**

Get real-time Blue notifications posted to the right Slack channels so your team is aware of important record updates.

## Key Benefits

**Automation Across Tools**: Zaps created in Zapier can automatically send and receive data between Blue and thousands of other apps. This eliminates manual work moving data between systems.

**Real-Time Integrations**: Using Blue's webhook triggers, Zaps react instantly to events in Blue like a new record, comment added, status change etc. This enables real-time synchronization and process automation.

**Easy to Build and Maintain**: Zaps provide a user-friendly, no-code way to integrate tools. No development work needed. And they keep working with no ongoing maintenance.

## Blue to Zapier

1. Log in to your Zapier account
2. Click Make a Zap  
3. For the first step, search for and select the ["Webhooks by Zapier" trigger app](https://zapier.com/apps/webhook)
4. Configure it to accept payloads from your Blue webhook URL
5. For the second step, search and select the destination app to send data to
6. Map the JSON payload fields to the input fields of the destination app
7. Turn on the Zap


Now when the specified events occur in Blue, the webhook payload will be sent to Zapier which automatically passes the data to your integrated app per the Zap settings.

## Zapier to Blue

To push data from other apps into Blue, follow these steps:

**3. Configure Webhook**

- URL: `https://api.blue.cc/graphql` (or beta endpoint if needed)
- Data Pass-Through: FALSE
- Unflatten: NO

**4. Set Headers:**
```json
{
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
  "X-Bloo-Token-ID": "Your_Token_ID",
  "X-Bloo-Token-Secret": "Your_Token_Secret", 
  "X-Bloo-Company-ID": "Your_Company_ID",
  "X-Bloo-Project-ID": "Your_Project_ID"
}
```

**5. Configure Query (Example Mutation):**
```json
{
  "query": "mutation CreateTodo($input: CreateTodoInput!) {\n  createTodo(input: $input) {\n    id\n    title\n    customFields {\n      value\n    }\n  }\n}",
  "variables": {
    "input": {
      "todoListId": "your-todo-list-id",
      "title": "New task from Zapier",
      "customFields": [
        {
          "customFieldId": "priority-field-id",
          "value": "High"
        },
        {
          "customFieldId": "due-date-field-id",
          "value": "2024-03-01"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**6. Test & Activate**
- Use Blue's API Playground to test mutations first
- Map dynamic values from trigger apps using Zapier's data fields
- Enable the Zap after successful testing
