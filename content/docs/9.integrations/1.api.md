Blue has an API (Application Programming Interface), so you can build your own integrations if required.

**Blue has 100% API coverage**. This means that anything that you can do in [any of our apps](/docs/start-guide/download-apps), you can do programmatically. We have a powerful [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API that has a full playground where you can test your queries and is fully documented.
