Blue allows you to sync calendar data with external calendars, including:

- Google Calendar
- Outlook
- iCal (Apple)

This means that calendar events from Blue can be shown in your personal or work calendar.

Note that the Calendar Sync works one-way: from Blue to your calendar, not vice versa.
::

There are three types of calendars in Blue that can be synced in Blue

- **Personal CalendarM**: All records that have a date that are assigned to you across all your projects
- **Project CalendarsM**: All records that have a date in a specific project.
- **Company CalendarM**: All records with a date in all projects you belong to.

The Blue calendar will now show as an available calendar to toggle on. Turn on the toggle to view this calendar within your calendar platform's interface. Now, whenever you add, edit or remove events in Blue's calendar, these changes will automatically sync to your connected calendar.

Syncing to external calendars keeps your Blue events integrated directly into your daily workflow and schedule across devices. This ensures you have complete visibility into upcoming work without context switching.
