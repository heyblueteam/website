title: CSV Import
description: The CSV import feature allows you to migrate data from other systems. It can handle up to 200,000 records at a time.

You can import CSV (Comma Separated Value) files. If you have an Excel file, [you can convert it to a CSV file at the following link](https://cloudconvert.com/xls-to-csv).



## Importing CSV

Importing CSV files in Blue is a straightforward process. Each column in your CSV file corresponds to a default or [custom field](/public/docs/custom-fields) in Blue.

To start, you must be the Project Administrator of the project where you want to import data. Click on the project settings icon (gear icon) and select "Import"

The Import Feature is available under Project Settings for Project Administrators 

In the screenshot above, you can also see another option called "Download CSV Template". This is extremely useful if you have already created your [custom fields](/public/docs/custom-fields) in your Blue project because you can download a CSV file that includes columns for all of your custom fields! This is great when you want to ensure that you have the precise structure for your CSV before importing.

Next, simply drag and drop your CSV file into Blue:

![CSV Import 2](/public/docs/CSVimport2.png "CSV Import 2")

Drag and drop to upload your data

Depending on your file size, this may take a few seconds for you to upload and for Blue to analyse. Once Blue has analysed the data, you will see a preview of the first ten rows of your data:

![CSV Import 3](/public/docs/CSVimport3.png "CSV Import 3")

You can then map each column in your CSV to a field in Blue.

## Handling Commas in Your Data

If your data contains commas (for example, in addresses or company names), you need to wrap those values in double quotes to prevent import errors. 

**Example:**
```
Company,Address
Acme Inc,123 Main St, New York
```

**Should become:**
```
Company,Address
"Acme Inc","123 Main St, New York"
```

This ensures the comma in "123 Main St, New York" is treated as part of the data rather than a column separator.
