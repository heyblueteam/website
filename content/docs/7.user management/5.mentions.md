## Group @mentions

You can easily @mention groups of users based on their assigned roles or @mention everyone involved in a project. This feature ensures that relevant members receive timely notifications and stay informed about important updates or discussions.

To @mention users based on their roles, you can use the following options:

**Predefined Roles:**

- @Admins: Mention all users with administrative privileges.
- @Team Members: Mention all users who are members to the project.
- @Clients: Mention all clients associated with the project.
- @View Only: Mention users who have view-only access to the project.
- @Comment Only: Mention users who can only leave comments within the project.
- @everyone: Mention everyone regarding their roles within the project.

**Custom Roles:**

- @Custom User Roles: Mention users assigned to specific custom roles you've defined within the project.

When you @mention a group by their role, all users within that selected role will receive notifications through their configured channels (e.g., email or push notifications). Additionally, the @mention will appear in their dedicated "@mention" box within Blue, ensuring they don't miss any important updates or conversations.
