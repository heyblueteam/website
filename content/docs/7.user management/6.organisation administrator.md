- **URL**: The  URL slug that users access i.e, app.blue.cc/company/blue
- **Icon**: The icon image displayed in the sidebar

**User Management**

**Remove Users** If someone leaves your company, you can fully remove them from the organisation by going to organisation settings and selecting the People tab.

Their access will be revoked. All their comments and files will still be visible across the projects. Of course, there's a confirmation prompt before deleting a member, so that you won't accidentally remove them.

Specific functions include:

- Update credit card details
