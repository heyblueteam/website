The Project Administrator is the highest-privilege role within a Blue project similar to Project owner. Project Admins have complete control over the project and its settings.

**Permissions**

Project Admins can:

- Edit all project settings
- Add/remove project members
- Assign user [roles](/public/docs/user-management/roles) and [permissions](/public/docs/user-management/roles/custom-user-roles)
- [Import](/public/docs/integrations/csv-import) and [export](/public/docs/integrations/csv-export) project data
- Delete project
- Create [custom fields](/public/docs/custom-fields)
- Create custom roles
- Setting [Automation](/public/docs/automations)

Essentially they have unlimited permissions within the project.

**Use Cases**

Typical users assigned as Project Admin:

- Project managers
- Team leaders
- IT managers
- Business owners

Anyone who needs to fully configure the workflow or manage members.

**Assigning the Role**

When inviting members, the Project Admin role can be assigned.

Existing members can also be promoted to Project Admin. But there must always be at least one Project Admin in a project.

**Removing the Role**

To remove Project Admin permissions from a member, they must first be demoted to a more restricted custom role or standard role.
