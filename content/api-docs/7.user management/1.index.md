  ## Add or Invite a User to Project

To invite a user to a project, you can use the following mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  inviteUser(
    input: {
      email: "test@gmail.com"
      projectId: "YOUR PROJECT ID OR SLUG"
      accessLevel: "ADMIN"
      roleId: "YOUR CUSTOM ROLE ID"
    }
  )
}
```

There are six [predefined user roles](/public/docs/user-management/introduction) in Blue:

1. OWNER
2. ADMIN
3. MEMBER
4. CLIENT
5. COMMENT_ONLY
6. VIEW_ONLY

When inviting a user to a project, you can specify one of these roles using the `accessLevel` parameter in the mutation.
