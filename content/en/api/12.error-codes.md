## Error Response Format

Blue's GraphQL API returns errors in a standardized format following the GraphQL specification. When an error occurs, the response includes an `errors` array with detailed information about what went wrong.

### Example Error Response

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Todo was not found.",
      "extensions": {
        "code": "TODO_NOT_FOUND"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Error Structure

Each error object contains:
- **message**: A human-readable description of the error
- **extensions.code**: A machine-readable error code for programmatic handling
- **extensions.stacktrace**: Available in development mode for debugging (not shown in production)

## Production Error Safety

Blue implements a safety system for error exposure:

- **Safe Errors**: Display actual error codes and messages to clients
- **Non-Safe Errors**: Return generic `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` to hide sensitive details
- **Resource Not Found**: All `*_NOT_FOUND` errors are considered safe and always exposed

## Error Categories

Blue defines 108 custom error codes organized into the following categories:

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is handled by the `graphql-rate-limit` package with different configurations:

| Limit Type | Window | Max Requests | Applied To |
|------------|--------|--------------|------------|
| Standard | 60s | 500 | Most queries/mutations |
| Sensitive | 300s | 10 | Password reset, auth operations |
| Expensive | 60s | 20 | Complex queries, bulk operations |
| Search | 60s | 60 | Search operations |
| File Upload | 60s | 100 | File upload operations |

When rate limited, you'll receive a standard GraphQL error with message indicating the limit exceeded.

### System & Internal Errors

| Error Code | Message | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` | "Internal server error." | Generic error for non-safe errors in production |

| `RESOLVER_NOT_FOUND` | "Resolver not found" | GraphQL resolver missing |
| `FIELD_NOT_IN_SCHEMA` | "Field not in schema" | Requested field doesn't exist |

## Error Handling Best Practices

### Client-Side Handling

```javascript
try {
  const result = await client.mutate({
    mutation: CREATE_TODO,
    variables: { input }
  });
} catch (error) {
  if (error.graphQLErrors?.length > 0) {
    const errorCode = error.graphQLErrors[0].extensions?.code;
    
    switch (errorCode) {
      case 'UNAUTHENTICATED':
        // Redirect to login
        break;
      case 'TODO_NOT_FOUND':
        // Show "Record not found" message
        break;
      case 'VALIDATION_ERROR':
        // Display validation errors
        break;
      default:
        // Show generic error message
    }
  }
}
```

### Common Error Scenarios

1. **Authentication Required**: `UNAUTHENTICATED` - User needs to log in
2. **Permission Denied**: `FORBIDDEN` - User lacks required role/permission
3. **Resource Not Found**: `*_NOT_FOUND` - Resource doesn't exist or user can't access it
4. **Validation Failed**: `VALIDATION_ERROR`, `BAD_USER_INPUT` - Check input parameters
5. **Rate Limited**: Check rate limit headers and implement backoff
6. **Payment Required**: `PAYMENT_REQUIRED` - Feature requires subscription
