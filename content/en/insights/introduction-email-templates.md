This guide provides Blue partners with a simple, effective way to introduce Blue to your existing clients and prospects.

## Blue in a Nutshell

**Blue is a flexible process management platform that's industry agnostic. It's constantly updated, helps organizations create clear processes, and layers in automations, dashboards, reports, and user permissions. It's super easy for teams to actually use.**

## The Introduction Email Template

Use this template when introducing Blue to your existing clients or warm prospects. Customize the highlighted sections based on your relationship and their specific needs.

### Subject Line:
"Quick introduction to a platform that might help [Company Name]"

### Email:

```
Hi [First Name],

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to introduce you to a platform that several of my clients are using to streamline their operations.

Blue is a process management platform that helps organizations create clear, repeatable workflows. What makes it interesting for companies like yours:

• Consolidates scattered processes (from Excel, email, Slack) into one system
• Gives everyone real-time visibility into what's happening
• Automates repetitive tasks so teams can focus on higher-value work
• Actually gets adopted by teams (unlike traditional enterprise software)

[Optional: Add specific relevance]
Given your recent [mention of scaling/growth/operational challenges], I thought it might be particularly relevant for [specific department/use case].

Here's what Blue typically helps with:
- Operations teams: Real-time dashboards and automated workflows
- Project delivery: Standardized processes that scale
- Compliance: Automatic audit trails and documentation
- Remote teams: Single source of truth accessible anywhere

Blue is enterprise-ready but deploys in 30 days, not 6-12 months like traditional systems. They work directly with their CEO who can make immediate decisions about custom features if needed.

Would you be interested in a brief conversation to see if this could help [Company Name]? I can introduce you to their partnership team, or we can explore it together.

Let me know if this is worth exploring.

Best,
[Your name]

## How to Position Blue Based on Their Situation

Adjust the middle section based on what you know about their challenges:

### If they're growing rapidly:
"I know you're scaling quickly - Blue helps growing companies maintain consistency without slowing down. It scales from 50 to 5,000+ employees without breaking."

### If they're struggling with visibility:
"You mentioned visibility challenges last time we spoke - Blue gives you real-time dashboards so you always know exactly where things stand."

### If they're compliance-focused:
"Given your industry's compliance requirements, Blue's automatic audit trails and process documentation might be particularly valuable."

### If they have remote teams:
"With your distributed team, Blue acts as a single source of truth that everyone can access from anywhere."

### If they're cost-conscious:
"Blue typically pays for itself in 60 days through automation savings. One client reduced manual work by 15 hours per week."

## Talk Tracks for Common Scenarios

### When They Say: "We already use [Competitor]"

**Your Response:** "That's great you have something in place. Most of our enterprise customers actually switched from [Competitor]. They tell us the main difference is that Blue can be customized to match their exact processes without coding or waiting months for IT. What specific challenges are you having with [Competitor]?"

### When They Say: "How is this different from project management tools?"

**Your Response:** "Great question. Project management tools are built for one-off projects with start and end dates. Blue is built for repeating processes - the work you do every day, week, or month. It's the difference between planning a house renovation (project) versus managing daily operations (process). Which type of work is causing more headaches for you?"

### When They Say: "We don't have budget"

**Your Response:** "I understand - budget is tight everywhere. That's actually why companies invest in Blue - it typically pays for itself in 60 days through automation savings alone. [Similar company] saved $50K in the first quarter just from eliminated manual work. Would it be worth 15 minutes to see if you have similar savings opportunities?"

### When They Say: "Send me information"

**Your Response:** "I could send you our generic materials, but they won't show you how Blue solves your specific challenges. How about I take 15 minutes to understand your situation and then send you a customized video showing exactly how Blue would work for [Company]? Would Thursday at 2pm work?"

### When They Say: "How much does it cost?"

**Your Response:** "Blue pricing is based on company size and needs, typically starting around $15K annually for enterprises. The ROI is usually 3-4x in the first year through efficiency gains. Should we explore if there's even a fit before discussing exact pricing?"

### When They Say: "Is it complicated to implement?"

**Your Response:** "Actually, no. Blue deploys in 30 days with their sprint methodology. They handle data migration and training. Your team can start seeing value in week one. Want me to share how [similar company] got up and running?"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ What NOT to Do:

1. **Don't lead with features**
   - Wrong: "Blue has 500+ integrations, custom fields, and AI capabilities"
   - Right: "Blue solves your visibility problem"

2. **Don't mention competitors in the first email**
   - Wrong: "We're better than Monday/Asana/ClickUp"
   - Right: Focus on their problems, not competitor comparisons

3. **Don't send massive attachments**
   - Wrong: 20MB pitch deck attached
   - Right: One relevant case study link

4. **Don't use corporate jargon**
   - Wrong: "Synergistic solution for digital transformation"
   - Right: "Makes your team's life easier"

5. **Don't pitch everyone the same way**
   - Wrong: Same template to CEO, Operations Manager, and IT Director
   - Right: Adjust your message to their specific role and pain points

6. **Don't ask for an hour**
   - Wrong: "Can we schedule an hour-long demo?"
   - Right: "15 minutes to see if this is even relevant"

## The Most Important Rule

**Be helpful, not salesy.**

If Blue isn't a fit, say so. If they need something else, recommend it. Build trust first, deals second.

Partners who focus on genuinely helping prospects - even when it doesn't lead to immediate sales - build the strongest, most profitable long-term relationships.

Remember: You're not selling software. You're solving business problems. Lead with empathy, understanding, and genuine curiosity about their challenges. The rest follows naturally.
