- **Mandates on-premise only** with no cloud component allowed

- **Looking for an out-of-the-box solution** with zero configuration

### ⚠️ Proceed with Caution

- **Slow response times** to initial outreach (>1 week)

- **Unwilling to share** current processes or pain points
- **"Just browsing"** with no timeline or budget allocated

### 🟡 Warning Signs That Can Be Overcome

- Budget concerns (demonstrate ROI and efficiency gains)
