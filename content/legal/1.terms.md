If you break any of the rules below, we might have to close your account. Using our service is entirely your choice and responsibility. We provide the service as it is and when it's available. We only offer technical support through email. Keep in mind that we use third-party suppliers and hosting partners to offer the necessary equipment, software, networking, storage, and related technology needed for the service.

You're not allowed to change or hack the service. Also, you can't alter another website to falsely suggest that it's linked to our service or our company. You agree not to copy, sell or use any part of the service without our written permission.

We can remove content and accounts that we believe are illegal or break any party's intellectual property or these terms of service. If you verbally, physically, or in writing abuse or threaten any service customer, company employee or officer, we will close your account immediately.

If you're using our service way more than the average customer, we might temporarily disable your account. We'll try to contact the account owner before we take any action, except in rare cases where the level of use could affect the service for other customers.

We can't promise that the service will meet your specific needs, be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free, or that the results from using the service will be accurate or reliable. We also can't guarantee the quality of any products, services, information or other material you get through the service, or that any errors in the service will be fixed.

You understand and agree that we're not responsible for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages. This includes loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses, even if we've been told about the possibility of such damages. This could result from:

- Using or not being able to use the service
- The cost of getting substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services bought or obtained, or messages received or transactions entered into through or from the service
- Unauthorised access to or alteration of your transmissions or data- Statements or conduct of any third party on the service
- Any other matter relating to the service

If we don't exercise or enforce any right or provision of the terms of service, it doesn't mean we've given up such right or provision. These terms of service make up the whole agreement between you and us and govern your use of the service. They replace any previous agreements between you and us (including any previous versions of the terms of service).

If you have any questions about the terms of service, you can email us at help@blue.cc. Any new features that add to or improve the current service, including the release of new tools and resources, will be subject to the terms of service. If you keep using the service after any changes, it means you agree to those changes.

## Refunds

We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for new subscribers to our project management software. This policy applies only to your first subscription purchase. You have 30 days from the date of your first order to request a refund. If you cancel within this 30-day period, we'll refund the full amount you paid.

To request a refund, simply write to us within 30 days of your first order. In your message, state that you wish to cancel your subscription and request a refund. No additional steps are required.

We'll process your refund in the same currency you used to pay us. Please note that this refund policy doesn't apply to renewals, upgrades, or changes to your subscription. We cannot refund any third-party fees (such as wire transfer fees) or compensate for currency exchange rate fluctuations. After the 30-day period, no refunds are available for paid subscriptions.

Lifetime Deals (LTDs) have special conditions. LTDs purchased directly from Blue are non-refundable. If you bought an LTD through a third party, it's subject to that third party's refund terms.

We reserve the right to deny refund requests if we believe they're made in bad faith or to avoid paying for services actually used and enjoyed, as permitted by law.

If you have any questions about our refund policy, please don't hesitate to contact our customer support team. We're here to help you understand our terms and ensure you're satisfied with our service.

## Service Level Agreement

Our Service Level Agreement (SLA) promises that our service, Blue, will be up and running 99.9% of the time. This means it might be unavailable for about 9 hours in a year. If we need to do any planned maintenance that might cause downtime, we'll try to let users know beforehand. We'll also do our best to schedule this maintenance during times when not many people are using the service. Our support team will try to respond to all questions and issues within 24 hours.

## File Storage

We provide 500GB of file storage per customer. Additional storage is available at $10 per TB (billed in increments of 1TB) for overage, paid yearly. Here are our storage policies to ensure fair service for all users:

- Storage Limits: Each customer receives 500GB of storage included with their plan. If you exceed this limit, additional storage is billed at $10 per TB annually.
- Review of High Usage: If your account is in the top 5% for data use or bandwidth, we'll need to take a closer look and may reach out to you for a customized plan. 
- Storage Usage: Our service is for sharing files within your processes, not for public distribution on forums or social media or as a backup service.
- Storage Management: Files not accessed for over 30 days move to slower storage. This helps us manage costs, but may mean these files make take a few seconds before opening.
- Responsible Uploading: Only upload files you're allowed to. Uploading private data of others without consent is not allowed.
- No Pornographic material: We do not allow pornographic material to be uploaded to our service.
- Absolutely No Illegal Content: Uploading viruses or anything illegal (like child pornography) is a serious offense. We'll have to terminate your account immediately if this happens.
- What Happens if Rules are Broken: If there's a policy breach or your usage affects our system's stability, we might need to temporarily suspend your account, limit your service, or take other steps. We'll try to chat first, though.

Abandoned accounts (no login for 3 months) will have files permanently deleted after 60 days notice.

## Non-Disclosure Agreement

At Blue, we deeply respect your privacy. Every piece of information you upload is treated with the utmost confidentiality. We do not examine or screen your data before you upload it, ensuring your privacy is maintained from the moment you choose to use our service. However, in rare cases where a government agency legally demands access to your data with a court order, we may be required to comply. It's important to note that once you delete a file from our system, it's irrevocably removed, making it inaccessible to both you and us. Furthermore, we ensure that the visibility of your data is restricted solely to those individuals whom you have explicitly included in your specific projects. This means that no one outside of your organization's account will have access to your information on Blue, safeguarding your data from external views. The only exception is when you decide to turn on Public Link sharing which enables anyone with the link to a specific file in Blue to be able to download it.
